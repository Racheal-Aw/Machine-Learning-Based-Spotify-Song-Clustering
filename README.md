# Machine-Learning-Based-Spotify-Song-Clustering
This project applies K-Means clustering to Spotify song data using unsupervised machine learning. By analyzing audio features like danceability, energy, and tempo, it groups similar songs into clusters to emulate curated playlists. The model achieved a 70% match with existing Spotify playlists.
